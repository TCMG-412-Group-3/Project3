#
# for this week's group project we must use the provided apache log file and answer the following questions:
# 1. how many total requests have been made in the 6 months?
# 2. how many total requests were made in the time period represented by the log


# 1. starting off with pseudocode, here is what we must do:
# parse the log file so that we can store the month as a variable "month"
# set a counter variable to 1 so int count = 0
# if the variable "month" is greater than 6 or == 1
# count += 1
# uncertainties: will we need a while loop to iterate through each line?

# 2. some pseudocode to start:
# set counter variable to 0
# create while loop to iterate through log file by line
# increase counter variable by 1 each iteration
# uncertainties: how will the loop know when to end?
